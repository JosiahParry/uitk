The final project will summarize all of this work in two pieces, the Individual and Group components.\nRubric\nProject: 12%\nPresentation: 8%\nGroup Portion: 5%\nIndividual Component\nThe final paper and presentation will present a research project that reveals one or more discoveries from the data set you have worked with this semester. The project should highlight the measure(s) that you have developed during the semester and incorporate at least one data set in addition to the one you were assigned at the beginning of the course. Note that you are welcome to use any material from the previous midterms and exploratory data assignments for this project.\nThe paper will be in the format of a public report, consisting of:\nA brief Executive Summary that details the main points of your analysis and findings. Think of the audience for this being someone who would benefit from the insights but might not have the time to read the whole paper or the desire to wade through methods.\nAn Introduction that describes the conceptual inspiration for your analysis and why it might be interesting, both conceptually and practically. You might also include hypotheses if appropriate. The Introduction should include a few citations to fully justify and motivate your analyses.\nA brief Data & Methods section that describes the content of your data set, how you calculated any new measures, and other data sources you used. This is not your complete Methods section, but just enough for a reader to be able to understand the content that follows. It should reference the Appendix (see below).\nOne or more Results & Discussion section where you describe your analyses. This might include some basic descriptive statistics (e.g., what is the distribution of a critical measure across the city, what is the average, the max, etc.) and more sophisticated statistical and visual analyses. This part of the paper should strive to tell one or more interesting stories.\nIt does not need to be titled Results & Discussion. In fact, it probably should have one or more subsections with titles that capture precisely what you discovered.\nThis must include either a correlation/regression or a t-test/ANOVA analysis, and at least three visualizations, one of which must be a map.\n\nA Conclusion that briefly interprets what you’ve found and suggests implications for research and policy. This can be about a page and to the point.\nA Methodology Appendix that describes the content of your data set and then summarizes how you calculated any new measures and from where you accessed other measures. Keep in mind that this section should not include detail for detail’s sake, but should provide the information necessary for an expert to (a) fully understand what you did and (b) replicate the work if they so desired.\nPlease use Chicago style for any references. Use in-line citations (as in the scientific papers we have read this semester). Include all references in the references section in alphabetical order and do not include any references not cited in the text.\nThe paper should be 12-15 pgs. of text. There is not a hard minimum for length, but if your paper is shorter than 12 pgs., it is unlikely you fully completed the expectations of the assignment.\nThe presentation that will accompany the paper will likely follow a similar structure, though presentations grant a little more flexibility in style. The Executive Summary will be more a part of your Introduction setting up the talk and there will be no Methodology Appendix, so be mindful of what is necessary for the presentation medium (but be ready for audience questions!). Please keep the presentations to no more than 5 minutes.\nRubric: Paper (Total 12 pts.)\nExecutive Summary: 1.5 pts.\nIntroduction: 1.5 pts.\nData & Methods: .5 pts.\nResults & Discussion: 3 pts.\nConclusion: .5 pts.\nMethodology Appendix: 2 pts.\nVisuals: 1.5 pts.\nDetails: 1.5 pts.\nGroup Component\nAs with the previous two midterms, the group will work together to combine all modifications made by group members into an updated data set and documentation. It will include three parts that will be uploaded to the Dataverse:\nThe record-level file with all new and modified variables included. This is an update of the record-level file submitted for the second midterm.\nAny files at the aggregate level (e.g., census tracts) and the variables describing them. This is an update of the aggregate level file(s) submitted for the second midterm.\nAn updated Data Dictionary that describes the new variables and, if necessary, modifies the description of any already existing variables, as well as variables at the aggregate level of the database.

I, Josiah Parry, will be your instructor for this asynchronous online offering. I am excited to equip you all with some of the tools needed to analyze the urban commons. While the tools you will learn will be useful, they are by no means the exhaustive list—this is quite impossible!\nThis course is based on Dr. Dan T. O’Brien’s course—the very same that I took a few years ago. I will, however, be making my own adjustments as I see fit and emphasizing the importance of the R programming language and its contemporary packages. A good (and fun) foundation in R is essential to ensuring that you want to continue exploring the urban commons.\nCourse Summary\nThe past decade has seen the rapid proliferation of large-scale digital data sets, from cell phone records to social media posts, from calls for government services to digitized historical records. With their unprecedented volume and detail, these new resources have opened up a window through which we can closely examine the behavioral and social dynamics of everyday life, and nowhere is this truer than in urban areas, which have the greatest density of both people and technology. This has given rise to urban informatics, and a renewed opportunity to understand the city, its people, and its neighborhoods, and to develop new policies and programs that improve urban life.

Be as concise as possible—fight the verbosity of academia!\nThe README must contain:\nA brief overview of what the data set contains. This should be a short paragraph composed of short sentences describing the source of the data and the type of information it holds. This will look a lot like the opening paragraph of the Data Dictionary that you have, though possibly even shorter.\nExample Insights Provide about 5-10 pieces of information that are notable and illustrate the nature of the data set. These should be both engaging and potentially useful to someone looking to analyze the data. Taken as a group, they should illustrate multiple ways that the data set might be used (i.e., not all referencing the same variable). For example: “The 311 system categorizes requests for service into 218 types, the most common being General Request.” “The neighborhood with the most 911 calls in 2013 was Dorchester.”\nVisualization. Include at least two visualizations that illustrate some aspect of the data set that you find particularly noteworthy, complementing the “fun facts.”\nKeep it as short as possible. No more than two pages should be necessary (usually). Remember that this is something that a visitor will want to read quickly to decide whether it is of interest. If it is too verbose you will be deducted points.\nTo review a strong example from a previous year, see attachment above.\nGroup Component\n\nMake sure your group includes:\nThe record-level file with all new and modified variables included.\nAn updated Data Documentation that describes the new variables and, if necessary, modifies the description of any already existing variables.\nAn R markdown document clearly articulating steps for all data cleaning and variable creation.

      "contents": "\nR Markdown documents can be customized to your liking and can be made way prettier than the defaults.\nThere are number of different themes that you can use out of the box! You can do this by changing your YAML header. The YAML header is the section at the top of your document enclosed by three --- on the top and the bottom. You can provide additional metadata to the header in the format of parameter: value. To change the default theme of the html_document output format we can adjust the header to look like the below.\n---\ntitle: \"Super creative title\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\ndate: The day of course.\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    theme: united\n---\nNotice that we’re adding some new lines and indentation to the output parameter. Think of this similarly how you use bulleted list indentation. The indentation is related to the thing above it. In the above example we’re telling output to be an html_document, then further under the html document, we’re specifying a theme.\nBootswatch themes\nThe themes that R Markdown can use out of the box are called Bootswatch Themes. These are some pre-created themes from web designers that can be applied to our document. The values you can pass to the theme parameter are default, cerulean, journal, flatly, darkly, readable, spacelab, united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, yeti\nCreating a table of contents\nSimilar to how we can modify the theme of a document, we can add a table of contents to help the reader navigate through the document. Under html_document: we can put the value toc: true to create a clickable table of contents at the beginning of the document. This is super helpful for people who want to navigate through your document or figure out where they’d like to start.\nYour YAML would look like\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    theme: united\n    toc: true\nFloating table of contents\nTo be an even fancier R Markdown creator, you can modify your table of contents to be floating. That means while a viewer is reading through your document the table of contents is still there and available to be clicked on and navigated. The modification is rather simple!\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    theme: united\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\nOther styles\nThere are a ton of other packages out there that you can use to modify your R Markdown themes to be really pretty in other ways. A few of my favorites are: distill, tufte, and pagedown.\nTry some of the following:\noutput: distill::distill_article. This requires the package distill.\noutput: tufte::tufte_html. This requires the packge tufte.\nThis requires the package cleanrmd. The instructions can be found at https://github.com/gadenbuie/cleanrmd.\noutput: \n  cleanrmd::html_document_clean:\n    theme: awsm.css\nThis requires the package prettydoc.\noutput:\n  prettydoc::html_pretty:\n    theme: leonids\nNote that you likely will need to install the related packages. You can do this with install.packages(\"distill\"), etc.\n\n\n\n",

Lander (available as e-book through NU library)\nR for Data Science by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund\nUrban Informatics Toolkit by Josiah Parry\n\nCourse Mission\nThe past decade has seen the rapid proliferation of large-scale digital data sets, from cell phone records to social media posts, from calls for government services to digitized historical records. With their unprecedented volume and detail, these new resources have opened up a window through which we can closely examine the behavioral and social dynamics of everyday life, and nowhere is this truer than in urban areas, which have the greatest density of both people and technology. This has given rise to urban informatics, and a renewed opportunity to understand the city, its people, and its neighborhoods, and to develop new policies and programs that improve urban life. Big Data for Cities takes an experiential approach that enables students to contribute to this young field. Given unprecedented times, we will apply our newfound skills to the urgent question of the shifting urban landscape in the age of COVID-19.\nCourse Outcomes\nCourse Content\nBig Data for Cities introduces students to the burgeoning field of urban informatics with an eye towards five learning outcomes:\nDescribe the Field of Urban Informatics: Students will read articles and websites that expose them to the researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and companies that are incorporating big data into the study and management of the city, from which they will seek to articulate the themes and connections that constitute the field of urban informatics.\n“Seeing” Neighborhoods through Naturally-Occurring Data: Students will acquire the methods necessary to manage, analyze, and interpret modern digital data (e.g., administrative records) using R statistical software, with a focus on translating data gathered from internet platforms into knowledge that meaningfully describes the dynamics of the city. This experiential aspect of the course is facilitated by the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI), a center at Northeastern that focuses on urban informatics in the region. The data come from BARI’s efforts to build the Boston Data Portal, which gathers and coordinates data from many sources describing the region; our work will also be informed by the input BARI partners who work in the public, private, and non-profit sectors locally. Data work this semester will focus on data sets that capture the shifting urban landscape in the time of COVID-19.\nSituating Internet Data in their Real-World Context: Naturally-occurring data are a rich source of information about a city, but it is necessary to verify what real-world events they actually describe and how they are meaningful. Students will undertake City Explorations in order to compare the patterns in their data to independent information about neighborhood contexts. They will also discuss their work with various local stakeholders, including public officials and community leaders. These experiences will ground our interpretation of the data while also empowering us to utilize them to support the real communities that they describe.\nCommunicating Discoveries: Analysis is only as useful as the insights that can be derived from it. Students will practice reporting and presenting the results of data analyses both orally and in writing in forms that would be used to communicate to a range of audiences.\nCreating Public Data Products: Students will modify and document improvements they make to the data sets used in the course. These will be stored in BARI’s Boston Data Portal, thereby creating new data products that can be used by others, including our local partners and future classes.\nLearning Dimensions: SAIL\nBig Data for Cities subscribes to Northeastern University’s campus-wide emphasis on experiential learning and does so with a focus on service-learning—that is, applying our newfound technical skills and substantive knowledge to the real-world needs and challenges of local partners. We will do this directly through our analyses of data describing the shifting urban landscape in Boston during COVID-19.\nAs such, the value of the course will be more than just the five content-specific learning outcomes described above; it will also help students to develop general competencies that are useful across contexts. These learning dimensions are captured by the Center for Advancement of Teaching and Learning through Research’s Self-Authored Integrated Learning (SAIL) framework. This course will particularly highlight three of their five dimensions.\nSAIL Dimension\nDefinition\nThis Course\nIntellectual Agility\nLearners develop the ability to use knowledge, behaviors, skills, and experiences flexibly in new and unique situations to innovatively contribute to their field.\nLeverage quantitative thinking for problem solving. Connect data to real-world phenomena. Adjust project goals with new insights.\nSocial Consciousness & Commitment\nLearners develop the confidence, skills, and values to effectively recognize the needs of individuals, communities, and societies and make a commitment to constructively engage in social action.\nIdentify civic challenges. Apply data to better understanding and serving the city. Recognize how to use data to better understand and advocate around problems.\nProfessional & Personal Effectiveness\nLearners develop the confidence, skills, behaviors, and values to effectively discern life goals, form relationships, and shape their personal and professional identities to achieve fulfillment.\nCoordinate individual and group-level efforts on a collaborative team. Gather and leverage the perspectives of external partners. Select project directions strategically by aligning analytic opportunities with public interest.\nCourse Format:\nThe course curriculum is broken into three parts, moving through the increasingly sophisticated things we can do with data: Information, Measurement, and Discovery.\nThe course will meet weekly remotely through Zoom.\nIt is encouraged that all students attend Zoom meetings. Though you will not be graded on attendance.\nWe will learn R, an open source statistical programming language.\nThe typical class meeting will be split into four parts:\nA short lecture on R or related data principles\nChecking in with students on challenges they are facing with R\nWorking through examples with students.\n\nThe R component of the course takes the form of a flipped classroom, meaning that students are expected to do their technical readings and exercises in advance of class. We will use the class time as a workshop to review these skills.\nData Collaborations:\nWe will learn how to use R to visualize, manipulate, and analyze naturally-occurring data by working with data sets from BARI’s COVID in Boston database which draws from numerous administrative and internet sources. Each student will be assigned to a collaborative team that will analyze one of these data sets. Teams will be constructed using the preferences expressed by students in the pre-semester survey.\nThe data collaborations will be the basis of weekly assignments and semester projects. All such assignments will be completed by individuals, but students are encouraged to share documents and modified data with each other. Teams will also work together to combine their advances with the data into data products. Major assignments and data products will be shared back with our municipal partners.\nData will be made available to students via BARI’s Boston Data Portal, hosted by Dataverse. You will need to create a Dataverse account. See instructions for using Dataverse on Canvas under Course Material - > Technical Support Documents.\nAssignments\nEach week will entail: readings with reading responses; and R-based data explorations. Each unit will also include one city exploration assignment, one midterm (or, for the third unit, the final project), and one service-learning reflection.\nReading Responses\nReadings are listed in the syllabus and will be posted on Canvas unless otherwise specified.\nEach reading assignment will be accompanied by a short reading prompt meant to guide reading.\nStudents will turn in their response to the reading prompt, which must be at least 250 words, on the Canvas discussion board designated for that week by Thursday at noon.\nStudents will be expected to browse each other’s responses as well. It will be required to respond to at least one other student’s response by Saturday\n\nPosts based on the reading prompt are graded out of 2 points: 2 = complete, 1 = incomplete (under word count / not entirely relevant to the reading / limited original thought), 0 = not turned in. Instructor will award partial points as appropriate.\nResponses to other students will be graded out of 1 point: 1 = complete, 0 = insufficient. There will be no partial credit. These responses do not have a length requirement, but need to comment substantively on the classmate’s original post. (For example, “This is a cool idea!” would not be sufficient, but “I really enjoyed the way you framed sensor systems in terms of their ethical challenges,” would be.)\nR-based Data Exploration\nR-based data explorations will ask students to practice the skills learned that week in R to analyze their data set. They will be described in detail during each week’s in-class workshop and posted on Canvas the week they are assigned.\nR-based data explorations will revolve around the data set that you have elected to focus on for the semester. Though students will work in collaborative groups everyone must turn in their own, independent work. Nonetheless, students are encouraged to collaborate with other group members and classmates in all work. These assignments are intended to build towards the midterm and final projects.\nThe write-up should address: Background, or why is this interesting?; Analysis, or what you found out?; and Interpretation, or what does this mean? It should be completed in an Rmarkdown document (.Rmd) that intermingles code and prose.\nR-based data explorations will be submitted twice, first as a Draft and then as a Final product. The drafts are due by Wednesday and the Final submission is due on Sunday at 23:59. They will be submitted on Canvas.\nR-based data explorations will be graded on syntax style according to style.tidyverse.org ch. 1 and 2.\nCity Exploration Assignments\nThere will be one city exploration assignment during each unit of the course in which students will visit a part of the city to which they have never (or rarely) been, either in person or virtually. Each walk will have a different theme, connecting the data curriculum of that unit to the real-world context of the municipality whose data you are analyzing. Guidance on whether to visit places in-person or virtually will be contingent on current circumstances and all city explorations will offer online resources for a virtual option.\nFor each city exploration assignment, students will complete a 4-5 pg. walk memo. Each walk memo must also include at least two pictures or screen shots from the exploration (not counted towards length). \nRubric for city exploration assignments included on the course website and Canvas where assignments are announced.\nService-Learning Reflections\nAt three points during the semester (see schedule), each student will write a 2-3 pg. (double- spaced) memo on: how their work in the course has been influenced by the perspectives of external partners and by exposure to real-world contexts; how those experiences have helped them to better understand the material and their data; and the ways in which the partnership has revealed the real-world utility of the skills. Students are also welcome to explore the limitations of these themes, or ways in which they would like to see them continue to grow.\nGiven that we will not be working direct external partners this semester and the challenges that remote learning face, please comment on how your analyses could be applied to existing social issues.\n\nService-learning reflections are graded out of 2 points: 2 = complete, 1 = incomplete (short / not fully engaging the question), 0 = not turned in.

Throughout this course we will expound upon the intersection of big data and the city with an emphasis on the importance of administrative data.\nIn recent years the city has seen a vast proliferation of data whether it be from cell phone records to social media posts, calls for government services, or to digitized historical records. These new resources present a clear opportunity for research, policy, and practice. Gleaning insights from these data require the use of modern statistical software, a nontrivial task! A further challenge is the rigorous standards needed to interpret the data collected. These skills form the foundation of the emerging field of urban informatics and therefore the main learning objectives of this course.\nThroughout this course we will use the Statistical Programming Language R for all of our data related tasks. Throughout this course we will utilize the books R for Everyone, R for Data Science, and The Urban Informatics Toolkit (UITK).\nTo prepare for the course, I would strongly suggest you read the below suggested readings. Additionally, please ensure you do your course preparation listed below prior to next week. All in all, it should take you about 30 minutes. 😊\nReadings\nUtility and Danger of Big Data\nData in the Municipal Context\nSchools of Urban Informatics\nCourse Preparation\nRead UITK Ch. 2: This chapter will introduce you to R, and the RStudio IDE.\nInstall R\nInstall RStudio\nPre-course survey\n\n\n\n",

It is up to the analyst to revise variables or to create new ones that makes this knowledge more accessible, that it might be leveraged for research, policy or practice. In this module, you will create new or revised variables in your own data set that facilitate subsequent analysis. This might include “fixing” or omitting erroneous cases, reorganizing to make an existing variable more tractable, or combining information from multiple variables to make critical information more directly accessible. We will also look at the world of “Smart Cities,” where private corporations like Google Sidewalk Labs have promised to leverage data to create technologies and programs that make urban systems more efficient and responsive—as well as some critics who make clear that making cities smart is about more than just data.

This symbiosis between theory and data has been critical to the work we have done thus far. As we have seen, extracting information from a data set requires knowing what we want to learn and making a number of decisions to reveal it through analyses and visualizations, and those analyses and visualizations then stimulate new questions. As we spend this week preparing for the midterm, we will be considering this question of what we can learn from our data set, and how we want to go about exposing it and communicating it through a Read-Me Document. In addition, we will read two essays about whether data “speak for themselves,” or if there is still a need for theory in guiding data science.\nLearning objectives\nAssess the role of theory in data science.\nDistinguish between data- and theory-driven approaches.\nSubstantive Readings\n“The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete,” by Chris Anderson, Wired.\n“The End of Theory in Science?” by Massimo Pigliucci, EMBO Reports.\nPrompt\nWhat’s your take on Anderson and Pigliucci’s debate about the role of theory in data science?\nAssignment\nFirst City Walk due Friday 23:59.\nLooking forward\nFirst midterm due next Friday!\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview\nA major criticism of big data and other “naturally occurring” records is that they have lots of information, but do they include the things we need and want to know? Put another way, what are they capable of measuring about people, places, and things? In this module, you will answer this question using two tools. The first is a schema, which allows us to understand how records connect to other data sets based on the very people, places, and things we want to know more about. The second is an approach to measurement that organizes the world into latent constructs, or underlying characteristics that we believe exist, and manifest variables, or measurable elements that reflect latent constructs. Through this lens, we can build measures that describe the features of those people, places, and things. We see this approach illustrated in a chapter about the work that my own organization, the Boston Area Research Initiative, has done to translate administrative data into a series of ecometrics that describe the social and physical characteristics of the neighborhoods of Boston.\nLearning objectives\n\nPropose aggregate measures from naturally-occurring data that are rooted in concepts of interest.\nSubset a data frame based on the contents of another data frame.\nConsider the implications of the data-generation process for the interpretation of aggregate variables.\nSubstantive Readings\nO’Brien 2018 The Urban Commons Chapter 2: Through pg. 65 and 85-90 required; summary sections for the rest of the chapter will suffice.\nBoston Area Research Initiative\nPrompt\nWhat is the ‘ecometric’ approach to big data and how does it solve the problem of ‘measurement’ in urban big data?\nHow does it fit in with BARI’s broader vision?\nData Assignment\nFor this week’s data assignment, propose at least one latent construct that you would like to measure with your data set and the geographic level at which you would want to measure it.\nIn addition, describe how this construct is interesting and at least one manifest variable for measuring it.

Part of the opportunity of “big data” is the potential to coordinate these data sets in order to analyze them in conjunction with each other. In order to do so, however, we must leverage the schemas we learned about in the last module—that is, the people, places, and things that they share in common—to link them. In this module, you will leverage the geographical infrastructure of Boston to develop aggregate measures describing some unit of analysis (e.g., streets, census tracts), and then link them with other information describing those same units.

I am a graduate of the Urban Informatics program here at Northeastern. I’ve gone through this curriculum myself!\nBack in September, inspired by the pandemic, I left the comfort of Central Square apartment to move to Portland, ME for a change. I will say that I miss Felipe’s, I miss Pavement coffee, and I miss wandering around Harvard Square and occasionally losing in chess games to Doc and buying him a Spanish latte. But Portland brings it’s own charisma and charm. It is quieter. It is has arguably tastier food and more quality espresso per square mile.\nIn my new apartment overlooking Portland’s West End you’ll find me working remotely for RStudio, PBC. That looks like a whole lot of zoom calls, emailing, and R programming. I am on the Customer Success team at RStudio working with our public sector customers. I get to discuss all things R, data, and infrastructure with government agencies around the world whether they be municipalities, state, or federal organizations.\nOn the weekends you can probably find me at Sunday River enjoying what little snow there may be.
