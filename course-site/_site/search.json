With their unprecedented volume and detail, these new resources have opened up a window through which we can closely examine the behavioral and social dynamics of everyday life, and nowhere is this truer than in urban areas, which have the greatest density of both people and technology. This has given rise to urban informatics, and a renewed opportunity to understand the city, its people, and its neighborhoods, and to develop new policies and programs that improve urban life. Big Data for Cities takes an experiential approach that enables students to contribute to this young field. Given unprecedented times, we will apply our newfound skills to the urgent question of the shifting urban landscape in the age of COVID-19.\nCourse Outcomes\nCourse Content\nBig Data for Cities introduces students to the burgeoning field of urban informatics with an eye towards five learning outcomes:\nDescribe the Field of Urban Informatics: Students will read articles and websites that expose them to the researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and companies that are incorporating big data into the study and management of the city, from which they will seek to articulate the themes and connections that constitute the field of urban informatics.\n“Seeing” Neighborhoods through Naturally-Occurring Data: Students will acquire the methods necessary to manage, analyze, and interpret modern digital data (e.g., administrative records) using R statistical software, with a focus on translating data gathered from internet platforms into knowledge that meaningfully describes the dynamics of the city. This experiential aspect of the course is facilitated by the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI), a center at Northeastern that focuses on urban informatics in the region. The data come from BARI’s efforts to build the Boston Data Portal, which gathers and coordinates data from many sources describing the region; our work will also be informed by the input BARI partners who work in the public, private, and non-profit sectors locally. Data work this semester will focus on data sets that capture the shifting urban landscape in the time of COVID-19.\nSituating Internet Data in their Real-World Context: Naturally-occurring data are a rich source of information about a city, but it is necessary to verify what real-world events they actually describe and how they are meaningful. Students will undertake City Explorations in order to compare the patterns in their data to independent information about neighborhood contexts. They will also discuss their work with various local stakeholders, including public officials and community leaders. These experiences will ground our interpretation of the data while also empowering us to utilize them to support the real communities that they describe.\nCommunicating Discoveries: Analysis is only as useful as the insights that can be derived from it. Students will practice reporting and presenting the results of data analyses both orally and in writing in forms that would be used to communicate to a range of audiences.\nCreating Public Data Products: Students will modify and document improvements they make to the data sets used in the course. These will be stored in BARI’s Boston Data Portal, thereby creating new data products that can be used by others, including our local partners and future classes.\nLearning Dimensions: SAIL\nBig Data for Cities subscribes to Northeastern University’s campus-wide emphasis on experiential learning and does so with a focus on service-learning—that is, applying our newfound technical skills and substantive knowledge to the real-world needs and challenges of local partners. We will do this directly through our analyses of data describing the shifting urban landscape in Boston during COVID-19.\nAs such, the value of the course will be more than just the five content-specific learning outcomes described above; it will also help students to develop general competencies that are useful across contexts. These learning dimensions are captured by the Center for Advancement of Teaching and Learning through Research’s Self-Authored Integrated Learning (SAIL) framework. This course will particularly highlight three of their five dimensions.\nSAIL Dimension\nDefinition\nThis Course\nIntellectual Agility\nLearners develop the ability to use knowledge, behaviors, skills, and experiences flexibly in new and unique situations to innovatively contribute to their field.\nLeverage quantitative thinking for problem solving. Connect data to real-world phenomena. Adjust project goals with new insights.\nSocial Consciousness & Commitment\nLearners develop the confidence, skills, and values to effectively recognize the needs of individuals, communities, and societies and make a commitment to constructively engage in social action.\nIdentify civic challenges. Apply data to better understanding and serving the city. Recognize how to use data to better understand and advocate around problems.\nProfessional & Personal Effectiveness\nLearners develop the confidence, skills, behaviors, and values to effectively discern life goals, form relationships, and shape their personal and professional identities to achieve fulfillment.\nCoordinate individual and group-level efforts on a collaborative team. Gather and leverage the perspectives of external partners. Select project directions strategically by aligning analytic opportunities with public interest.\nCourse Format:\nThe course curriculum is broken into three parts, moving through the increasingly sophisticated things we can do with data: Information, Measurement, and Discovery.\nThe course will meet weekly remotely through Zoom.\nIt is encouraged that all students attend Zoom meetings. Though you will not be graded on attendance.\nWe will learn R, a freeware statistical program.\nThe typical class meeting will be split into four parts:\na discussion of the week’s readings;\nworkshop on analyzing data in R;\nshort presentations of student work;\nreflections on service-learning and the social impact of our projects.\n\nThe R component of the course takes the form of a flipped classroom, meaning that students are expected to do their technical readings and exercises in advance of class. We will use the class time as a workshop to review these skills.\nData Collaborations:\nWe will learn how to use R to manipulate, analyze, and visualize naturally-occurring data by working with data sets from BARI’s COVID in Boston database, which draws from numerous administrative and internet sources. Each student will be assigned to a collaborative team that will analyze one of these data sets. Teams will be constructed using the preferences expressed by students in the pre-semester survey.\nThe data collaborations will be the basis of weekly assignments and semester projects. All such assignments will be completed by individuals, but students are encouraged to share documents and modified data with each other. Teams will also work together to combine their advances with the data into data products. Major assignments and data products will be shared back with our municipal partners.\nData will be made available to students via BARI’s Boston Data Portal, hosted by Dataverse. You will need to create a Dataverse account. See instructions for using Dataverse on Canvas under Course Material - > Technical Support Documents.\nWeekly assignments (see below) will be posted on a course blog meant to communicate progress and to advance discussion and brainstorming. Instructions for using the blog are posted on Canvas under Course Material -> Technical Support Documents.\nAssignments\nEach week will entail: readings with reading responses; and R-based data explorations. Each unit will also include one city exploration assignment, one midterm (or, for the third unit, the final project), and one service-learning reflection.\nReading Responses\nReadings are listed in the syllabus and will be posted on Canvas unless otherwise specified.\nEach reading assignment will be accompanied by a short reading prompt meant to guide reading. We will jumpstart class discussion using the Canvas discussion board in advance of class.\nStudents will turn in their response to the reading prompt, which must be at least 250 words, on the Canvas discussion board designated for that week by Tuesday at noon.\nStudents will be expected to browse each other’s responses as well. It will be required to respond to at least one other student’s response by class time on Wednesday.\n\nPosts based on the reading prompt are graded out of 2 points: 2 = complete, 1 = incomplete (under word count / not entirely relevant to the reading / limited original thought), 0 = not turned in. Instructor will award partial points as appropriate.\nResponses to other students will be graded out of 1 point: 1 = complete, 0 = insufficient. There will be no partial credit. These responses do not have a length requirement, but need to comment substantively on the classmate’s original post. (For example, “This is a cool idea!” would not be sufficient, but “I really enjoyed the way you framed sensor systems as in terms of their ethical challenges,” would be.)\nR-based Data Exploration\nR-based data explorations will ask students to practice the skills learned that week in R to analyze their data set. They will be described in detail during each week’s in-class workshop and posted on Canvas the week they are assigned.\nR-based data explorations will revolve around the data set that you have elected to focus on for the semester. Though students will work in collaborative groups everyone must turn in their own, independent work. Nonetheless, students are encouraged to collaborate with other group members and classmates in all work. These assignments are intended to build towards the midterm and final projects.\nThe write-up should address: Background, or why is this interesting?; Analysis, or what you found out?; and Interpretation, or what does this mean? It should be completed in an RNotebook (.rmd) format that intermingles code and narrative.\nR-based data explorations will be submitted twice, first as a Draft and then as a Final product.\nCity Exploration Assignments\nThere will be one city exploration assignment during each unit of the course in which students will visit a part of the city to which they have never (or rarely) been, either in erson or virtually. Each walk will have a different theme, connecting the data curriculum of that unit to the real-world context of the municipality whose data you are analyzing. Guidance on whether to visit places in-person or virtually will be contingent on current circumstances and all city explorations will offer online resources for a virtual option.\nFor each city exploration assignment, students will complete a 4-5 pg. walk memo. Each walk memo must also include at least two pictures or screen shots from the exploration (not counted towards length).\nClass on the week of city exploration assignments will conclude with a series of 3 min. student presentations describing their city exploration. Each student will give one such presentation during the semester.\nRubric for city exploration assignments included on Canvas where assignments are announced.\nService-Learning Reflections\nAt three points during the semester (see schedule), each student will write a 2-3 pg. (double- spaced) memo on: how their work in the course has been influenced by the perspectives of external partners and by exposure to real-world contexts; how those experiences have helped them to better understand the material and their data; and the ways in which the partnership has revealed the real-world utility of the skills. Students are also welcome to explore the limitations of these themes, or ways in which they would like to see them continue to grow.\nService-learning reflections are graded out of 2 points: 2 = complete, 1 = incomplete (short / not fully engaging the question), 0 = not turned in. Instructor will award partial points as appropriate.\nMidterms and Finals\nEach section of the course will conclude with a major project. These are:\nInformation: Read-Me Documentation will provide a short series of facts derived from the data set that anyone working with the data might find informative. It will include code for replicating the analyses underlying these facts so that the report might be updated regularly or for subsets of the data.\nMeasurement: Original Measurement will describe a novel set of measures that have been derived from your data set, code that can replicate their construction, and a description of their distribution across the city.\nDiscovery: Inform, Measure, and Discover will combine the work from the two midterms with original analyses that utilize the measures and insights you have developed across the semester.\nAt each of these junctures collaborative teams will work together to organize and document the additions and modifications they have made to their data set, creating a single data product they will upload to the Boston Data Library.\nRubrics are posted with the fuller assignment descriptions on Canvas.\nGrading\n10% Attendance & Participation\n10% Reading Responses and Other Small Assignments\n10% Walk Memos\n15% Week-to-Week R Assignments\n15% Information Mid-Term Project: Read-Me Document 15% Measurement Mid-Term Project: Original Measurement 25% Final Project (Paper and Presentation)\nAcademic Honesty:\nStudents are expected to abide by Northeastern University’s Academic Integrity Policy, which you can read at: http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academicintegrity/\nIncompletes:\nThe grade incomplete (INC) is granted only where a student is approved to make up a single key requirement of the course, such as one of the major assignments.\nOther Expectations:\nClass will start promptly at 5:15. Please be on time. If you are late for any reason, please enter without disturbing the class.\nWe will typically end by 8:15. This is a 4-credit course, which assumes 3 hrs. 20 min. of course time weekly. The remaining time will be put towards out-of-class viewing of online lectures.\nThe use of communication devices during class will not be tolerated. Upon entering, please turn off all cellular phones and related devices. Please also keep computers off during activities and discussions that do not require them.\nLate assignments will be discounted 20% per weekday. After a week, they will no longer be accepted. If an assignment was to be posted online in advance of class to stimulate discussion there will be no opportunity for late credit.\nE-mailed assignments, except in the case of an absence, will be considered 1 day late.\nLate assignments or absences will only be considered excused in the case of a doctor’s note or evidence of an academic conflict.\n\n\n\n",

Throughout this course we will expound upon the intersection of big data and the city with an emphasis on the importance of administrative data.\nIn recent years the city has seen a vast proliferation of data whether it be from cell phone records to social media posts, calls for government services, or to digitized historical records. These new resources present a clear opportunity for research, policy, and practice. Gleaning insights from these data require the use of modern statistical software, a nontrivial task! A further challenge is the rigorous standards needed to interpret the data collected. These skills form the foundation of the emerging field of urban informatics and therefore the main learning objectives of this course.\nThroughout this course we will use the Statistical Programming Language R for all of our data related tasks. Throughout this course we will utilize the books R for Everyone, R for Data Science, and The Urban Informatics Toolkit (UITK).\nTo prepare for the course, I would strongly suggest you read the below suggested readings.

It is up to the analyst to revise variables or to create new ones that makes this knowledge more accessible, that it might be leveraged for research, policy or practice. In this module, you will create new or revised variables in your own data set that facilitate subsequent analysis. This might include “fixing” or omitting erroneous cases, reorganizing to make an existing variable more tractable, or combining information from multiple variables to make critical information more directly accessible. We will also look at the world of “Smart Cities,” where private corporations like Google Sidewalk Labs have promised to leverage data to create technologies and programs that make urban systems more efficient and responsive—as well as some critics who make clear that making cities smart is about more than just data. Finally, this week will feature the first City Exploration assignment in which you will virtually visit a neighborhood of your choice in order to determine whether the patterns that you are seeing in your data set mean what you think they do about what is actually going on in a neighborhood.\nLearning objectives:\nLearning objectives for this module are to:\nPlanning out the preparation of data for analysis by cleaning and creating more useful variables.\nCreate new variables that modify an existing numeric variable or are combinations of multiple numeric variables.\nCreate new variables based on existing string (i.e., character) variables.\nCreate and manipulate date variables with package lubridate.\nVisualize the relationships between multiple variables.\nEvaluate the private corporation approach to “smart cities”\nEvaluate the validity of naturally-occurring data with real-world events and conditions.\nSubstantive Readings\nLinkNYC\nSidewalk Labs\nSidewalk Toronto\n“Smart City Playbook” by the Mayor’s Office of Urban Mechanics in Boston\n“Google’s Guinea-Pig City” by Molly Sauter, The Atlantic\nPrompt\nHow would you describe the ‘smart cities’ approach to urban big data and its critiques?\nWhat is your opinion of how data is being used and interpreted in this context?\nTechnical Readings\nLander: Chapters 3, 7, 15.1\nCreating New Measures\nGrammar of layered graphics\nVisualizing Trends and Relationships I\nVisualizing Trends and Relationships II\nData Assignment\nCreate at least three new variables, each of which must either;\nmake some angle of your data’s content more interpretable,\nfix some issue in the data.\nPlease make sure to explain why these variables are useful.\n\nDescribe the contents of these variables using analysis and visualization.\nSkills needed:\nmutate()\nifelse()\ncase_when()\n\n\n\n",

This symbiosis between theory and data has been critical to the work we have done thus far. As we have seen, extracting information from a data set requires knowing what we want to learn and making a number of decisions to reveal it through analyses and visualizations, and those analyses and visualizations then stimulate new questions. As we spend this week preparing for the midterm, we will be considering this question of what we can learn from our data set, and how we want to go about exposing it and communicating it through a Read-Me Document. In addition, we will read two essays about whether data “speak for themselves,” or if there is still a need for theory in guiding data science.\nLearning objectives:\nAssess the role of theory in data science.\nDistinguish between data- and theory-driven approaches.\nSubstantive Readings\n“The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete,” by Chris Anderson, Wired.\n“The End of Theory in Science?” by Massimo Pigliucci, EMBO Reports.\nPrompt\nWhat’s your take on Anderson and Pigliucci’s debate about the role of theory in data science?\n\n\n\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nOverview\nA major criticism of big data and other “naturally occurring” records is that they have lots of information, but do they include the things we need and want to know? Put another way, what are they capable of measuring about people, places, and things? In this module, you will answer this question using two tools. The first is a schema, which allows us to understand how records connect to other data sets based on the very people, places, and things we want to know more about. The second is an approach to measurement that organizes the world into latent constructs, or underlying characteristics that we believe exist, and manifest variables, or measurable elements that reflect latent constructs. Through this lens, we can build measures that describe the features of those people, places, and things. We see this approach illustrated in a chapter about the work that my own organization, the Boston Area Research Initiative, has done to translate administrative data into a series of ecometrics that describe the social and physical characteristics of the neighborhoods of Boston.\nLearning objectives:\nDescribe the schema associated with a dataset.\nPropose aggregate measures from naturally-occurring data that are rooted in concepts of interest.\nSubset a data frame based on the contents of another data frame.\nConsider the implications of the data-generation process for the interpretation of aggregate variables.\nSubstantive Readings\nO’Brien 2018 The Urban Commons Chapter 2: Through pg. 65 and 85-90 required; summary sections for the rest of the chapter will suffice.\nPrompt\nWhat is the ‘ecometric’ approach to big data and how does it solve the problem of ‘measurement’ in urban big data?\nHow does it fit in with BARI’s broader vision?\nService Learning Response\nNow that you’ve completed your midterm, how did the city walk and in-class workshop influence the practical application of your analysis in working with the data? Going forward, what are your goals in this aspect (practical application-wise)?\nData Assignment\nFor this week’s data assignment, propose at least one latent construct that you would like to measure with your data set and the geographic level at which you would want to measure it.\nIn addition, describe how this construct is interesting and at least one manifest variable for measuring it. Use the latent construct modeling notation from this week’s lesson presentation to bring it across.\nNote: Your manifest variable can be an idea at this point and we can figure out how to code it in R in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview:\nData come from many different sources—in this class alone you all are working with multiple data sets that describe distinct aspects of the city. Part of the opportunity of “big data” is the potential to coordinate these data sets in order to analyze them in conjunction with each other. In order to do so, however, we must leverage the schemas we learned about in the last module—that is, the people, places, and things that they share in common—to link them. In this module, you will leverage the geographical infrastructure of Boston to develop aggregate measures describing some unit of analysis (e.g., streets, census tracts), and then link them with other information describing those same units. We will also learn about the Actionable Intelligence for Social Policy’s efforts to solve this same problem for linking information about individuals across the data generated by the many different agencies responsible for health and human services.\nLearning objectives:\nCalculate measures at aggregate levels from records\nLink data from different sources using shared units of analysis in a schema\nVisualize two variables together in a dot plot in ggplot2\nEvaluate the validity of measures\nEvaluate the trade-offs surrounding data analysis and privacy\nSubstantive Readings\nChoose one of the two papers:\nCulhane et al. (2007). “Testing a typology of family homelessness based on patterns of public shelter utilization in four U.S. jurisdictions”\nBowden et al. (2020). “Case identification of mental health and related problems in children and young people using the New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure.”\nAnd peruse Actionable Intelligence for Social Policy.\nPrompt\nIDSes merge a wealth of personal data to support comprehensive scholarly and policy analysis.\nTry to draw a diagram of the schema that you think enabled the study that you read. What other research questions do you think that that the data in that schema might be able to answer?\nTechnical Readings\nLander: Chapters 11.2, 12.1\nUITK:\nSummary Statistics\nSummarizing the tidy way\n\nR4DS - Grouped summarise with summarise()\nData Assignment\nBe sure to describe why the construct is interesting and how the specific calculations you are using capture it.\nAs you analyze the content of these new variables, be sure to include at least one dot plot that shows the relationships between two variables at the aggregate level.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview:\nData describing the city are special because they all reference the same set of buildings, streets, and neighborhoods. As we saw last week, this enables us to easily link measures that describe the same units. It also means that these data are spatial, and can be communicated and examined through maps. In this module, you will create maps that illustrate the distribution of one or more measures across the urban landscape. We will also learn about the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London, one of the original urban informatics research centers, and their efforts to map the city.\nLearning objectives:\nDescribe the differences between spatial data and traditional tabular data\nUtilize spatial data files in R.\nCreate chloropleths that map the distribution of a metric across the city using ggplot2 and ggmap\nProcess and visualize spatial data in R in a variety of additional ways.\nTrace the origins of spatial analysis in urban informatics.\nConnect the content of administrative data with real-world events and conditions.\nSubstantive Readings\nRogers (2013). “John Snow’s data journalism: the cholera map that changed the world.”\nPalominos & Smith (2020). “Identifying and Characterising Active Travel Corridors for London in Response to COVID-19 Using Shortest Path and Streetspace Analysis.”\nThe Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis\nTechnical Readings\nUITK - Spatial Analysis\nData Assignment\nContinue working on the development of your latent constructs and any related unit-level variables.\nCreate a map of at least one of these variables.\nMake sure to use the map as a way to reveal the distribution of this variable across the city and to further our understanding of the urban landscape.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview:\nAs we conclude Unit 2 it is time again to reflect a bit on our use of administrative data. First, as with last semester, we will use workshops to ensure that the measures that we are building are in fact interesting, meaningful, and potentially useful for research, policy, and practice. This will culminate in the completion of the second midterm, which will report these measures and their content. We will also read Danah Boyd and Kate Crawford’s “Six Provocations for Big Data,” which further forces us to consider the philosophical and ethical challenges that accompany this work.\nLearning objectives:\nAssess the philosophical challenges of working with modern digital data\nSubstantive Readings\nBoyd & Crawford 2011 Six provocations for big data\nPrompt\nHow do you find Boyd & Crawford’s ‘provocations’ useful for the field of urban informatics?\nAre there particular issues that you think this field does particularly well with and others where it needs to mature?\n\n\n\n",
