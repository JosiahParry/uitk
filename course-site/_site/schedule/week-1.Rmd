### Assignment: Telling A Data Story

For this week's data assignment, briefly describe the structure of either your whole data set or of some meaningful subset (number of rows, columns, names of relevant variables).

Describe at least three cases (rows) from this set/subset using the information contained in the variables you see as relevant.

-   What have you learned from these cases individually, and from the differences between them?
-   How do they illustrate what we can learn from these data more generally?
-   Can you infer things about the cases that are not explicitly in the data?

**Skills needed**:

- read_csv()
- select()
- filter()
- arrange()
- count()
- janitor::tabyl()
- summary() / skimr::skim()
