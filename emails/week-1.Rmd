Week 1 

This week you will be receiving your datasets. 
You will need to have access to the BARI dataverse. See instructions. 

You will be required to read https://style.tidyverse.org/

Chapters 1 and 2. I will grade all of your work according to this style guide. Please bookmark it.

You'll notice that the file names have periods and various capitalizations. Please rename your files with the appropriate names. For example the file named `YELP.Documentation.pdf` should be written as `yelp-documentation.pdf`.
